          Hi, my name is Alexander and I've been interested in how things have
          worked my entire life. Ths lead me to two fields, computer science and
          psychology. This encapsulated both the workings of natural and
          artificial elements of our world. Coming to UIUC I found a major that
          served as the perfect blend of my interests, CS + Anthropology. With
          anthropology I can take the theories of individual cognition and
          behavior from psychology and apply them to analyze how commmunities
          live and think. Bringing the tools of computation into the mix, I seek
          to understand the different approaches we can take to innovation and
          creation to enhance the lives of every community.
        </p>

        <p>
          I love to create in my freetime. The process of building something
          larger from the sum of smaller parts is truly gratifying and never
          gets old. I am infactuated with problem solving and I'm obsessed with
          learning new tools and techniques in order to find the best solutions.
          Outside of computer science and anthropology I am an avid music lover.
          I play electric guitar in a band on my campus called Venus Overdrive
          and thoroughly enjoy both playing music and recording, mixing, and
          mastering tracks!
